## Development Notes and Troubleshooting
Some notes and troubleshooting occurred during development

### Course backup remains on pending
This is a problem, if moodle is installed locally. Asynchronous backups must be disabled.
This can be done in the moodle administration site:
`Site administration` > `Courses` > `Asynchronous backups`

### Creating a new version
Some steps must be taken if a new version if the plugin should be released.
1. Increase the plugin-version in the file `version.php`. More information can be found in the specified file.
2. If any changes regarding the database were taken (e.g. a column/table added or removed), this can be
   done in `db/update.php`. The required code can mostly be generated using the moodle XMLDB Editor. More Information
   about the XMLDB Editor can be found [here](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/xmldb).
3. Create the new Zip for the Plugin: Zip the contents of the Plugins, so that the following structure is created:
   ```
   regexmatchcloze.zip
    | - db
      | - ...
    | - ...
    | - version.php
   ```
    - The `.git` and `.idea` folder should not be added to the zip file.

### supported PHP Version and Moodle Version
Make sure, that the Plugin supports the lowest PHP version possible for your supported
moodle version. (Set the PHP Language Level to that version)
The supported moodle version must be set in `version.php.
- [Required PHP Version](https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/PHP)
- [Moodle Versions](https://moodledev.io/general/releases)

### database errors after installation
- Check the state of the required databases using the Moodle Adminer Plugin
  (`Site administration` > `Server` > `Moodle Adminer`)
  and "repair" the database using a customized version with a `update.php`, which
  will repair the database. It is possible, that simply allowing `update.php` to run again
  may fix the problem.

### Uninstalling the plugin
To uninstall the plugin no questions of this plugin may exist. To achieve this, all entries in
the table `mdl_question` where the variable `qtype` is `regexmatchcloze` must be deleted. The Plugin
[Moodle Adminer](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_adminer) can be used to easily do this.
